# JOY ZADAN
## Full Stack Software Developer 
### About me üëã

Hi and thanks for visiting!

I'm an ex-b2b and enterprise sales pro who's discovered a love for coding. I'm passionate about continuously learning new languages and coding methods and equally dedicated to advancing my knowledge of the languages I already know. 

From 5th July 2022, I will start a three months internship as a full stack developer intern (part-time). I will be joining a team of Project Manager/ Scrum Master, Technical Supervisor, Product Manager, Backend Engineer (PHP), Mobile Engineer (Flutter), Frontend Engineer (React), QA Engineer, UX Designer and Graphic Designer to build an Application for a client in the Commodities industry. 

**February 2023 Update:** Having completed my last milestone project, I'm now continuing on with my internship (assigned to the Mineral Axis project) at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/squadglobal/" alt="Squad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Squad</a>. Squad is a UK and UAE based technology startup, building the next generation of community-based online commerce platforms to act as a bridge between WEB2.0 and WEB3.0. They also build applications for other industry sectors, one of which is commodities where I am assigned.
