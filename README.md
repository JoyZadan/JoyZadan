## Junior Full Stack Software Developer 
### About me ðŸ‘‹

Hi and thanks for visiting!

I'm an ex-b2b sales pro who's discovered a love for coding. I'm passionate about continuously learning new languages and coding methods and equally dedicated to deepening my knowledge of the languages I already know.

A couple of months from now (August 2022), I shall be completing Code Institute's Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development (full stack software development). I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python and am continuously practicing and learning to further my abilities to code in these languages. 

My goal as a budding full stack developer is to join a team of established developers where I can contribute to building great products whilst enjoying the development process and learning more along the way.

**Update:** From July 2022, I will start a two to three months internship as a full stack developer intern (part-time). I will be joining a team of Project Manager/ Scrum Master, Technical Supervisor, Product Manager, Backend Engineer (PHP), Mobile Engineer (Flutter), Frontend Engineer (React), QA Engineer, UX Designer and Graphic Designer as they develop an Application for a client in the Commodities industry.
